### Hi there 👋

My name is Ola Hagerupsen Hansen, and I am currently studying Industrial Economics and Technology Management at NTNU in Trondheim⚡

I am passionate about coding, but I mostly code for fun and learning😄
I have experience working with JavaScript, React, TypeScript, and Python, and I am currently diving into the world of Java as part of a school subject👨🏽‍💻 

On my GitHub, you can see my projects and contributions😎
